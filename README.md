Star Labs Assessment

How to run: You should just be able to open the index.html file after unzipping the file and the project should run. An internet connection is required also.

I have tested it in the following browsers: Firefox Developer Edition Version 66.0b1 (64-bit) Firefox Version 64.0.2 (64-bit) Chrome Version 71.0.3578.98 Brave Version 0.25.304 Safari Version 12.0.2 (14606.3.4)

And also on my mobile phone (OnePlus 6T)

Let me know if you have any issues running it, I tried to keep it simple.
